# Task-Manager
The task manager in this repository will allow users to add tasks, view tasks, mark tasks as complete and remove tasks. Theres also an added feature for the tasks to be stored or deleted from a external file.
In this repository, you can view the building blocks of the final code and a user guide for my code. Detailed comments of my code are also available in the code.
